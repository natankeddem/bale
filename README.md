## Installation

### Using Docker

1. Download `docker-compose.yml`.

2. Customize the `docker-compose.yml` file to suit your requirements.

3. Run the application using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Using Proxmox LXC Container

1. Download `pve-install.yml` and `inv.yml`.

2. Ensure you have a compatible Debian template available and updated `inv.yml` accordingly.

3. Customize the `inv.yml` file to match your specific setup requirements.

4. Execute the Ansible playbook for Proxmox LXC container installation against your Proxmox host:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inv.yml pve-install.yml
   ```

### Manual install on Debian

1. Install required packages.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y git python3-pip python3-venv sshpass
   ```

2. Clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/natankeddem/bale.git
   ```

3. Move to bale directory.

   ```bash
   cd bale
   ```

4. Create python virtual environment.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv ./venv
   ```

5. Activate virtual environment.

   ```bash
   source ./venv/bin/activate
   ```

6. Install pip3 packages from requirements.txt
   
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. Exit the virtual environment.
   
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

8. Edit `resources/bale.service` with the actual path you are utilizing on your system.

   ```bash
   nano resources/bale.service
   ```

9. Change paths in `resources/bale.service` if needed then copy to service directory and activate.

   ```bash
   sudo cp resources/bale.service /etc/systemd/system
   sudo systemctl enable bale.service
   ```
10. Start the service and check status.

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start bale.service
    sudo systemctl status bale.service
    ```

    #### Troubleshooting
    If you get an error like this: `bale.service: Failed to locate executable /root/bale/venv/bin/python: No such file or directory`, modify the path in your `/etc/systemd/system/bale.service` file.
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/bale.service
    ```

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl start bale.service
    sudo systemctl status bale.service
    ```
